# Battleship Game
 About the Game: I created this game using the knowledge I gained after completing a C++ course on the Udemy platform. It's a simple and fun version of the classic Battleship game where you can test your strategic skills.  Features: Grid: Play on a 10x10 board. Random Ships: Ships are placed randomly, making each game unique. Choose Ships: Decide how many ships to add (up to 16). Score Points: Hit ships to score points. Easy Interface: Simple menus and clear instructions.  How to Play:  Start the Game: Choose "Play" from the menu. Enter Name: Type your name. Add Ships: Pick the number of ships (1-16). Attack: Choose coordinates to attack and try to hit ships. Score Points: Earn points for each hit. End of Game: After using all your chances, see your score and choose to play again, go to the menu, or exit.
