# Battleship Game
 ## About the Game: 
 I created this game using the knowledge I gained after completing a C++ course on the Udemy platform. It's a simple and fun version of the classic Battleship game where you can test your strategic skills.  
 
 ## Features
 Grid: Play on a 10x10 board. Random Ships: Ships are placed randomly, making each game unique. Choose Ships: Decide how many ships to add (up to 16). Score Points: Hit ships to score points. Easy Interface: Simple menus and clear instructions.
   
 ## How to Play:  
 Start the Game and Choose "Play" from the menu, then type your name and pick the number of ships (1-16). After the game start choose coordinates to attack and try to hit ships. Earn points for each hitten ship. After using all your chances, see your score and choose to play again, go to the menu, or exit.
